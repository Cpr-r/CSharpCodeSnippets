# CSharpCodeSnippets
A repository that hosts simple code snippets that often serve a unilateral purpose. Feel free to implement these into your own programs. You do not need to ask for permission or credit me or anything like that. All I ask is that, if you find bugs or errors in my implementations, please let me know.
